Welcome to my page created for the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer">Full Stack Engineer</a> Path, Challenge Project: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fscj-22-improved-styling-with-css/modules/wdcp-22-build-a-website-design-system-2a08b912-678e-4186-ab57-86a0fb0ca601/projects/independent-project-web-design-system">Build a Website Design System</a>

In this project, the goal was to create a static page, website style guide, to assist in helping to more quickly make websites in the future!

Requirements were to include sections on:
* Theme colors with their respective hex/rgb.
* Font showcase and styles.
* Style guide showing default rulesets for common elements.

In addition I have included an interactive section on the Float css property.

Javascript was not not required for this project, but I did utilize it to enhance the user experience. I hope to update this guide as my full stack knowledge grows.
